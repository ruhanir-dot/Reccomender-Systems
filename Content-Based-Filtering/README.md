# Assignment 1: Content-Based Filtering — Next Item Retrieval

## Task Description

You are given a dataset of user–item interactions from software product reviews. Each user has a history of items they reviewed, along with review text, ratings, and timestamps.

For each user in the test set, you are given **5 candidate items**. Your task is to **rank these 5 items by content relevance to the user** — that is, based on how well each candidate's content matches the user's preferences as reflected in their history.

This is a **retrieval/ranking** task using **content-based filtering**.

## Core Concepts

1. **Item Representation:** Use item content from `item_metadata.csv` (title, description, features, categories, etc.) to build a vector for each item. Methods like **TF-IDF** or **Bag-of-Words** on text fields are a good starting point.

2. **User Representation:** Build a user profile from their interaction history in `train.csv`. You can:
   
   - Aggregate the content vectors of items the user has rated
   - Use the user's own review texts to build a text-based profile
   - Weight by rating, recency, or other signals

3. **Ranking:** For each user's 5 test candidates, score how well each candidate matches the user's profile, and rank them from most relevant to least relevant.

### Files Provided

| File                    | Description                                                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `train.csv`             | User interaction history with review text                            |
| `test.csv`              | Test set: 5 candidate items per user (10,000 rows = 2,000 users × 5) |
| `item_metadata.csv`     | Content features for all items                                       |
| `sample_submission.csv` | Example submission format                                            |

### Data Schema

**train.csv** — your training data (split this yourself into train/validation as needed):

| Column        | Type   | Description                                 |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `user_id`     | string | User identifier (e.g., `u_0042`)            |
| `item_id`     | string | Item identifier (e.g., `i_1234`)            |
| `rating`      | float  | Rating the user gave (1–5)                  |
| `review_text` | string | The user's review text                      |
| `timestamp`   | int    | Unix timestamp of the review (milliseconds) |

**test.csv** — 5 candidate items per user:

| Column    | Type   | Description               |
| --------- | ------ | ------------------------- |
| `user_id` | string | User identifier           |
| `item_id` | string | Candidate item identifier |

For each user, there are exactly 5 rows representing 5 candidate items.

**item_metadata.csv** — content features for each item:

| Column           | Type   | Description                   |
| ---------------- | ------ | ----------------------------- |
| `item_id`        | string | Item identifier               |
| `title`          | string | Product title                 |
| `description`    | string | Product description           |
| `features`       | string | Product feature bullet points |
| `categories`     | string | Product categories            |
| `main_category`  | string | Top-level category            |
| `store`          | string | Developer / seller name       |
| `price`          | float  | Product price                 |
| `average_rating` | float  | Global average rating         |

### Dataset Statistics

- **Users:** 2,000
- **Items:** 8,681
- **Training interactions:** 32,206
- **Reviews per user:** 10–48 (mean 16.1)
- **Test:** 2,000 users × 5 candidates = 10,000 rows

## Submission Format

Submit a CSV file named `submission.csv`. For each user, provide a **ranked list of all 5 candidate items**, ordered from most relevant to least relevant:

```
user_id,rank_1,rank_2,rank_3,rank_4,rank_5
u_0000,i_7284,i_4556,i_6084,i_4817,i_6617
u_0001,i_3339,i_5967,i_6257,i_0734,i_4458
...
```

### Requirements

- **Exactly 2,000 rows** — one row per user in `test.csv`.
- **`user_id`** must match the user IDs in `test.csv`.
- **`rank_1`** through **`rank_5`**: your ranking of the 5 candidate items, from most relevant (rank_1) to least relevant (rank_5).
- All 5 items must come from that user's candidate set in `test.csv`.
- No duplicate items within a row.
- See `sample_submission.csv` for the exact format.

## Tips

- **Start by exploring the data.** Plot rating distributions, look at review text examples, check what metadata fields are available.
- **Split your training data** into a train and validation set yourself. A natural approach: hold out each user's last interaction(s) from `train.csv` for validation.
- **Think about what makes a good user profile.** A user who loves puzzle games will have reviews mentioning "puzzle", "brain teaser", etc. — their profile should reflect this.
